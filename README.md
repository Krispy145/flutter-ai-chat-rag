## 🔑 Highlights

- **Cross-platform** → Android, iOS, Web support
- **State Management** → Riverpod/GetIt for reactive updates
- **Dependency Injection** → Clean architecture with GetIt
- **Type Safety** → dart_mappable for data modeling
- **Networking** → Dio with interceptors and error handling
- **CI/CD** → GitHub Actions + Shorebird OTA updates
- **Testing** → Unit, widget, and golden tests

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

```
lib/
 ├─ core/           # DI, error handling, networking
 ├─ data/           # DTOs, entities, sources, repositories
 ├─ features/       # feature modules (providers, pages, widgets)
 └─ presentation/   # app shell, router, theme
```

**Patterns used:**

- **Repository pattern** → clean separation between UI and data
- **Riverpod/GetIt** → reactive state management and dependency injection
- **dart_mappable** → type-safe data modeling
- **Dio** → HTTP client with interceptors and error handling
